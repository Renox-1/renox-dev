    <p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
      This site — and my blog at <strong><a href="https://blog.renox.dev">blog.renox.dev</a></strong> — is built with <strong>Astro</strong> and styled using <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>. It’s deployed from GitHub via CI and served out of my own homelab through a Cloudflare Tunnel.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-400 italic">
      The goal? Learn more about web development, CI/CD, and have somewhere to post all my random notes!

      <p>Before my pivot to infrastructure, I worked at the cutting edge of esports — managing programs, building tooling, and creating scalable workflows in a space where rapid iteration is a survival skill.</p>
      <p>That experience taught me to optimize under pressure, lead collaborative teams, and constantly adapt — skills that translate cleanly into my IT career today.</p>
